+DMitry (Deepmagic Information Gathering Tool) is a UNIX/(GNU)Linux
+command line application with the ability to gather as much information 
 as possible about a host.
 
-DMitry has a base functionality with the ability to add new functions.
 Basic functionality of DMitry allows for information to be gathered about a
-target host from a simple whois lookup on the target to UpTime reports and TCP portscans.
+target host from a simple whois lookup on the target to uptime reports and TCP portscans.
 
 The application is considered a tool to assist in information gathering when
 information is required quickly by removing the need to enter multiple commands 
 and the timely process of searching through data from multiple sources.
 
-To get straight into DMitry without reading this document, you can initially
-type "dmitry target", this will perform the majority of functions on the target.

 .SH OPTIONS
 Options should be passed to DMitry in the form of '-option'.
 Only options known by DMitry will be used and others will be ignored.
 If options are not passed as a group block, the trailing options will be considered a host target.
 .TP
 .B -o filename

+Create an ascii text output of the results to the filename specified.  If no output filename is specified
 then output will be saved to "target.txt".  If this option is not specified in any form output will be sent to

+the standard output (STDOUT) by default.  This option MUST trail all other options, i.e. "dmitry -winseo target". 
 .TP
 .B -i
-Perform an Internet Number whois lookup on the target.  This requires that the target be in the form of a 4 part Internet Number
-with each octal seperated using the `.' notation. For example, "./dmitry -i 255.255.255.255".
+Perform an Internet Number whois lookup on the target IP address.
 .TP
 .B -w
-Perform a whois lookup on the 'host' target.  This requires that the target be in a named character format.
-For example, "./dmitry -w target" will perform a standard named whois lookup.
+Perform a whois lookup on the host target.
 .TP
 .B -n
-Retrieve netcraft.com data concerning the host, this includes Operating System, Web Server release and UpTime information
-where available.

+Perform a subdomain search on the specified target.  This will use several search engines to attempt to locate subdomains
+in the form of sub.target.  There is no set limit to the level of subdomain that can be located, however, there is a maximum
 string length of 40 characters (NCOL 40) to limit memory usage.  Possible subdomains are then reversed to an IP address, if
 this comes back positive then the resulting subdomain is listed.  However, if the host uses an asterisk in their DNS records
 all resolve subdomains will come back positive.
 .TP
 .B -e
-Perform an EmailAddress search on the specified target.  This modules works using the same concept as the SubDomain search by
-attempting to locate possible e-mail addresses for a target host.  The e-mail addresses may also be for possible sub-domains of
-the target host.  There is a limit to the length of the e-mail address set to 50 characters (NCOL 50) to limit memory usage.

 .TP
 .B -p
-Perform a TCP Portscan on the host target.  This is a pretty basic module at the moment, and we do advise users to use something
-like nmap (www.insecure.org/nmap/) instead.  This module will list open, closed and filtered ports within a specific range.  
-There will probably be little advancement upon this module, though there will be some alterations to make it a little more user
-friendly.  There are also other options for this module that can affect the scan and its relative output.

+For example, "dmitry -pf target".

 .B -t

+This section presents some example queries that can be made using dmitry. 
 
-.B dmitry -w example-host.com
+.B dmitry -w mydomain.com
 
 This will perform a named whois (INIC-WHOIS) lookup on the target host, displaying results to the standard output (STDOUT).
 
-.B dmitry -winsepo sometextfile.txt example-host.com
+.B dmitry -winsepo sometextfile.txt mydomain.com
 
 This will perform all the basic functions on the target host and store all the output into "sometextfile.txt".
 
-.B dmitry -winsepo example-host.com
+.B dmitry -winsepo mydomain.com
 
-This will perform all the basic functions on the target host and store all the output into "example-host.com.txt".
+This will perform all the basic functions on the target host and store all the output into "mydomain.txt".
 
 .B dmitry -winsepfbo 127.0.0.1
 
-This will perform all the basic functions on the target host and store all the output into "127.0.0.1.txt".  This
-will also display banners and show filtered ports.
